The Financial Crime Team want access to data, baseed arround user activity to enable them in analyzing trends and behaviors that may identify potential Financial Crime Activity

Current Process at a high level works as below:
1. Policy Admin System are writing away in real time system logs of what users are doing and the screens they have visited
2. Those System Logs are interrogated by daily batch jobs and a file based data extract is generated by each policy admin system
3. These files are delivered daily to the SL Admin Team, who administrate directive controls. 
4. The reports per policy Admin system are merged to give a single report view. 
5. The SL Admin Team manually scan the combined report to spot 'suspicious' behavior.
